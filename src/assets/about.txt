Rarea Studio is 6 months old! As the end of the year approaches, we wanted to celebrate the Holidays with all of you and create a space where we could all share our thoughts and best wishes regardless of the distance that may separate us. Help us shape our tree and leave your comment!

Warmest wishes and Happy New Year,
Rarea team

No trees were harmed in the making of this Holiday Greeting.

RAREA is a partnership formed by Patricia Mascarell Llombart and Daniel Vera Villalobos, two Valencian architects based in London. In their practice, they seek and explore new methods to present research and focus on the connection between the built environment and the inhabitant, which they call ‘invisible architecture’.
